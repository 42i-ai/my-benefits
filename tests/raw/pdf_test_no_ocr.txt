Benefits at a Glance 
The City of Loveland is proud to offer comprehensive wellness and health benefits to eligible 
employees and their dependents, and is committed to partnering with employees to ensure that 
they get the best possible benefit from their plans.
Enrollment and Employee Contributions
Employees pay their portion of premium contributions for medical, dental and vision insurance on a pre-tax 
basis through payroll deductions 24 times per year. Employees may only make changes to their elections 
during the annual open enrollment period or within 31 days of a qualified change in family status as described 
in the “Change in Family Status” section of this enrollment booklet.
Employees can, at any time make, changes to their 457 retirement plan, W-4 and direct deposit accounts. 
Supplemental Life can, at any time, be added, dropped or changed subject to approval by the Hartford’s 
medical underwriting. 
New employees must enroll in or waive all benefit plans within 31 days from date of eligibility. If 
medical coverage is not elected, nor waived, employees will be automatically enrolled 
in the Medical - HRA (Choice Fund) plan.
Open Enrollment
Open enrollment is the only time, other than during a change in family status, you can 
make changes to existing benefit elections. Benefit changes you may make during open 
enrollment include:
 
 
• Add or delete dependents
 
 
• Switch, enroll, or waive medical plans
 
 
• Add or delete dental or vision
 
 
• Enroll or renew flexible spending accounts
3
Change in Family Status
Employees may make changes to their benefit elections within 31 days of a 
qualified change in family status as described below:
• Change in legal marital status due to marriage, civil union ceremony, 
death of a spouse, divorce, annulment or legal separation;
• Change in number of dependents due to birth, adoption, placement  
for adoption, or death of a dependent;
• Change in employment status of employee, spouse or dependent 
due to termination or start of employment, strike, lockout, beginning 
or end of unpaid leave of absence, including FMLA, or change in 
worksite;
• Change in residence of employee, spouse or dependent to a location 
outside of the employer’s network service area;
• Changes which cause a dependent to be eligible or ineligible for 
coverage, including attainment of age 26;
• A change in coverage in order to comply with a court order;
• Change in dependent care provider or salary paid to provider 
(dependent flexible spending only);
• A change in coverage due to Medicare or Medicaid eligibility 
changing;
• You may make a coverage election change if the plan of your spouse 
or dependent incurs a change such as adding or deleting a benefit 
option; allows election changes due to special enrollment, change 
in status, court order, Medicare or Medicaid Eligibility/Entitlement or 
the City plan and the other plan have different periods of coverage or  
open enrollment periods.
Dependents
Dependents are defined as:
• The employee’s lawful spouse/common law spouse (with signed affidavit);
• Civil Union Partner by way of legal certificate.
• Any dependent less than 26 years old; or
• Over the age of 26 and primarily supported by you and incapable of self-sustaining employment  
  by reason of mental or physical handicap.
• A child includes a legally adopted child or a child placed for adoption.
Anyone who is eligible as an employee can be considered either an eligible employee or a dependent, but 
they cannot be both. No one may be considered as a dependent of more than one employee. Benefits for a 
dependent child will continue until the last day of the calendar month in which the limiting age is reached.
It also includes:
•  A stepchild who lives with you.
•  Child(ren) of your Civil Union Partner.
Enrollment changes must be consistent with the change in family status. Your application for election changes 
will not be accepted without supporting documentation.
Note: In the event an employee misses the 31-day deadline for submitting a change in family status, the City will be unable to 
retroactively make changes to the enrollment due to IRS tax regulations (including any premium costs which the employee may 
have incurred).
4
Benefits Continuation/COBRA
Employees enrolled in the medical, dental, vision plan, 
and/or a flexible spending account who experience 
a “qualifying event” may be eligible to continue 
coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Some examples of 
“qualifying events” that affect employees or covered 
dependents include: end of employment, death of 
a covered employee, or the change in eligibility of a 
dependent. Employees covering a dependent must 
notify the Human Resources Department of certain 
qualifying events (divorce, legal separation, or a child 
ceasing to be a dependent under the plan) within 31 
days of the event.
Employee Health Clinic
The City features a free, confidential Employee Health Clinic to support the wellness needs of City employees. 
The clinic offers a wide variety of services for individuals (ages 2+) on our medical plan, including spouses, 
dependent children, retirees and COBRA participants. 
The City’s COBRA Plan Administrator will provide a written notice of COBRA 
rights and obligations within 44 days of a “qualifying event.” Employees 
will be required to pay the full cost of any COBRA coverage elected, plus 
an administration fee. Continuation of benefits through COBRA must be 
elected within 60 days of the later of either: a) the qualifying event, or b) 
the date the employee or his/her covered spouse/dependent children are 
advised by the COBRA Plan Administrator of their right to continued benefits. 
Please refer to the summary plan descriptions for additional information on 
COBRA rights and obligations.

Dental Plan
The dental plan covers cleanings and a variety of dental expenses subject to certain 
limits, deductibles, copayments, and restrictions. The City’s dental coverage is self-
insured and claims are paid and administered by Delta Dental of Colorado. Delta 
Dental offers two distinct provider networks, and also allows services from dentists 
outside the networks.
The Delta Dental PPO network offers a wide selection of dentists. The dentists in the 
PPO network provide services at the maximum savings level. The Delta Dental Premier 
network also has a wide selection of dentists. The dentists in the Premier network 
provide services at a slightly higher cost than the dentists in the PPO network.
Note: If the dentist is outside the Delta Dental networks, services are usually not discounted, which 
results in a higher out-of-pocket cost.

Vision Plan
The vision plan is administered by Vision Service Plan (VSP). The vision plan offers both in-network 
and out-of-network coverage. Employees may choose any licensed provider for vision care services. 
If an out-of-network provider renders services, the employee will be reimbursed up to the maximum 
allowances shown on the schedule of vision benefits. The most current list of in-network providers 
can be found on the VSP website at www.vsp.com or by calling 1-800-877-7195. Employees will pay 
the full premium for the vision plan.
Employees enrolled in VSP will not receive an ID card. Employees simply inform the provider that 
coverage is with Vision Service Plan (VSP). The provider and VSP handle the rest. If the provider is out-
of-network, the employee must pay for services and submit a claim for reimbursement.

Employee Assistance Program 
All eligible City employees and their household members are 
automatically enrolled in the EAP. The employee assistance 
program is a confidential telephone assistance and referral service 
provided by ComPsych Guidance Resources. Through this plan, 
employees have access to a number of health, wellness, legal 
resources and discounts 24 hours a day. The program can direct 
employees to appropriate external professional help or coordinate 
treatment through their medical plan.
There are no membership ID cards for the employee assistance 
program. Employees simply call the toll-free number 1-800-327-
1850. All EAP-related activity is strictly confidential in accordance 
with the laws that govern an employee resource plan.
An EAP professional may treat you for up to six (6) face-to-face 
visits per issue at no charge. After 6 visits for the same issue, the 
employee or his/her dependent will be referred to your medical 
plan for further treatment.
Medical plan benefits may apply if the employee or his/her 
dependent is referred for treatment is covered by the medical 
plan.

com for information and available resources on a variety of work/
life topics. To create your own personal username and password, 
use Company ID: HLF902.
Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Plans
The City offers employees the opportunity of opening a health care flexible 
spending account and/or a dependent care flexible spending account administered 
by PayFlex. These accounts allow employees to set aside pre-tax dollars from each 
paycheck to help pay for unreimbursed eligible health care and dependent care 
expenses for employees and family members.
Health Care Flexible Spending Account
The health care flexible spending account allows employees to use pre-tax dollars 
to pay for out-of-pocket eligible health care expenses. Eligible family members 
include any person you claim as a dependent for income tax purposes. Employees 
can set up a health care flexible spending account regardless of enrollment in a 
medical plan offered by the City.
Eligible health care expenses not covered by a plan include deductibles, 
copayments, and amounts paid out-of-pocket for eligible medical, dental, vision, 
and prescription drug expenses. A maximum of *$2,500 per year can be contributed 
into the health care flexible spending account. 
*New IRS maximum as of January 1, 2013.
Health FSA Debit Card
Participants who elect to enroll in the health care flexible spending account (FSA) 
have the option to receive a FSA debit card. Payments are made directly from the 
FSA account to the approved provider. IRS regulations require itemized receipts are 
saved. PayFlex may also request copies of receipts. There is a $15 annual debit card 
fee paid by the participant.
Note: Civil Union Spouse / Dependents are NOT eligible for the Health FSA.
9
Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account
The dependent care flexible spending account allows employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for 
eligible dependent care expenses, such as day care for children or care for an older family member. 
Eligible expenses include care at a qualified day care center, nursery school expenses, before and 
after school child care and certain types of expenses related to elder care.
Employees can contribute up to a maximum of $5,000 per year per household into the dependent 
care flexible spending account.
FSA Rules and Regulations
Plan annual FSA contribution amounts carefully; the election made when enrolling is binding for the entire plan 
year (January 1 to December 31) unless there is a qualifying change in family status. Additionally, the IRS www.
irs.gov imposes some rules and restrictions on the way employees can use flexible spending accounts:
Filing FSA Claims for Reimbursement
To file a claim for health or dependent care reimbursement, simply complete a reimbursement 
form and submit it with a copy of expenses (include a medical explanation of benefits if 
submitting a health claim). Claims may be submitted on-line, mailed or faxed to PayFlex.
For additional information, please contact Payflex at 1-800-284-4885 or visit their website at 
www.healthhub.com.
• Eligible expenses must be incurred during the plan year.
• Claims for reimbursement for the plan year and any grace period claims (through  
  March 15) must be submitted prior to the claims submittal deadline of March 30.
• If the family incurs fewer expenses than expected, any money remaining in your   
  FSA(s) will be forfeited and cannot roll over from  one plan year to the next.
• Employees cannot transfer money from one account to another; money in health 
  care FSA cannot be used for dependent care expenses, and money in dependent 
  care FSA cannot be used for health care expenses.
• Re-enrollment is required each year
Note: Civil Union Spouse / Dependent are NOT eligible for the Health FSA.
10
Supplemental Life
In addition to City-paid life insurance, employees may purchase supplemental life insurance for themselves, 
their spouse (including Civil Union Spouse) and/or their dependent children. All premiums are paid through 
payroll deductions on an after-tax basis.
An employee who enrolls in supplemental life Insurance when they first become eligible may enroll without 
providing evidence of good health as long as they select an amount that does not exceed the guaranteed 
amount indicated below. With evidence of good health, employees may purchase coverage up to the plan 
maximum of $300,000. An employee that declines coverage when first eligible and wishes to apply at a later 
date will be required to provide evidence of good health for any benefit amount. The supplemental life insurance 
plan is administered by The Hartford.
Short Term Disability (STD) Plan
Employees who are unable to work due to a non-work related illness or injury for more than fourteen (14)
consecutive calendar days employees may be eligible for short term disability (STD). If partially disabled after 
the elimination period employees may be able to work part-time and receive reduced pay from the City, as well 
as a STD benefit. Medical criteria is determined by The Hartford.
To apply for STD employees must contact The Hartford at 1-888-651-0393 and necessary information including 
the physician’s contact information. The Hartford will contact the physician. Please refer to the Human Resources 
intranet page for plan details.

Criteria for short term disability:
Long Term Disability (LTD) Plan
The long term disability (LTD) plan has a 90 day elimination period, and benefits may be payable on 
the 91st day of the disability. Employees do not have to be out of work for 90 consecutive days in 
order to satisfy your LTD elimination period. If employees return to work for any period of time less 
than 45 days, and go out for the same disability, that time will apply toward the elimination period.
If partially disabled, employees may be eligible to work part-time and receive reduced pay from the 
City, as well as a LTD benefit. Each injury/illness will be different, and will be reviewed on a case-by-
case basis as it relates to partial disability. Different injuries/illness will be calculated separately.
Long term disability medical criteria is determined by The Hartford. Benefits are paid by The Hartford 
at 60% of base wages (with a monthly benefit maximum of $5000). Benefits will be offset by other 
income sources. Please refer to the Human Resources intranet page for access to the plan document.
NOTE: LTD income through this plan is considered taxable income. The Hartford will withhold state and federal taxes 
from the benefit. Social Security is taken from the benefit for six (6) months and matched by the City of Loveland. Please

Private Health Information
A portion of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996 (HIPAA) addresses the protection of confidential 
health information.  It applies to all health benefit plans.  
In short, the idea is to make sure that confidential health 
information that identifies (or could be used to identify) you 
is kept completely confidential.  This individually identifiable 
health information is known as “protected health information” 
(PHI), and it will not be used or disclosed without your written 
authorization, except as described in the Plan’s HIPAA Privacy 
Notice or as otherwise permitted by federal and state health 
information privacy laws. A copy of the Plan’s Notice of Privacy 
Practices that describes the Plan’s policies, practices and your 
rights with respect to your PHI under HIPAA is available from 
your medical plan provider. For more information regarding 
this Notice, please contact the Human Resources Department.
Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act
The City’s medical plans, as required by the Women’s Health and 
Cancer Rights Act of 1998, provide benefits for mastectomy-
related services.  These services include: 
• 
All stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the 
mastectomy was performed 
• 
Surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce 
a symmetrical appearance 
• 
Prostheses and treatment of physical complications 
resulting from mastectomy (including lymphedema) 
This coverage will be provided in consultation with the 
attending physician and the patient, and will be subject to 
the same annual deductibles and coinsurance provisions that 
apply to the mastectomy.  For more information, contact your 
medical plan provider.
Individual Coverage Mandate
Effective January 1, 2014, Federal law requires that you have 
Health Care coverage or you may be subject to an income tax 
penalty.  You can enroll in the City’s health plan, or you may 
want to consider visiting  www.healthcare.gov for information 
on health plans available through the Healthcare Marketplace 
in your area.
Notice of Prescription Drug Creditable Coverage
The City provides a “Notice of Prescription Drug Creditable 
Coverage” to all Medicare eligible participants on an annual 
basis.  This notice states that under the The City medical plan, 
you have prescription drug coverage that is, on average, as 
generous as the standard Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage.
Premium Assistance Under Medicaid and the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
If you or your children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and 
you are eligible for health coverage from your employer, your 
State may have a premium assistance program that can help 
pay for coverage. These States use funds from their Medicaid 
or CHIP programs to help people who are eligible for these 
programs, but also have access to health insurance through 
their employer. 
If you or your children are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, you 
will not be eligible for these premium assistance programs.
If you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or 
CHIP and you live in a State listed below, you can contact your 
State Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance 
is available.
If you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in 
Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents 
might be eligible for either of these programs, you can contact 
your State Medicaid or CHIP office or dial 1-877-KIDS NOWor 
www.insurekidsnow.gov to find out how to apply. If you qualify, 
you can ask the State if it has a program that might help you 
pay the premiums for an employer-sponsored plan.
Once it is determined that you or your dependents are eligible 
for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, as well as 
eligible under your employer plan, your employer must permit 
you to enroll in your employer plan if you are not already 
enrolled. This is called a “special enrollment” opportunity, and 
you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined 
eligible for premium assistance. If you have questions 
about enrolling in your employer plan, you can contact the 
Department of Labor electronically at www.askebsa.dol.gov or 
by calling toll-free 1-866-444-EBSA (3272).
